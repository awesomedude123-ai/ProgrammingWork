                <p style="text-align:left;word-wrap: normal;width:330px;"> My name is Sri Mukkamala. I am a second year student studing cybersecurity. My application focus area is a combination of Law and Policy, and Applications
                Development. In addition, I am doing the Business Certificate as well. I am the treasurer for IST Student Government and foudned a new IST club called Fundamentals of Computing Association. </p>

                    I sadly do not have any pets. If I was given the choice to adopt my own pet, I would adopt fish because it would be low maintenance and I would enjoy just
                    watching them swim in their tank. I also feel that it would be better for my kind of personality which tends to be more reserved and distanced from people and animals. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:right;float: right;word-wrap: normal;width:330px;" > My favorite book is the Nowhere Man. It is about an assassin's program that gets decommissioned by the president, former founder of the program.
                To remove all traces of the program, the president hires former "Orphans" (Assassins were called Orphans) to hunt and kill the last remaining orphans. The main 
            protagonist is the best Orphan out of them who stays underground while helping out poor people who contact him in need of help. The story is how he stays alive and 
        eliminates all enemies including the president of the country. </p>
